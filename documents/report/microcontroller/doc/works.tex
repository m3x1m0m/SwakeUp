The hardware right now is in revision 2.0. There has been one revision before the current one. This revision has been fabricated in january 2017 and the design process began in november 2016. There were some mistakes on the first hardware revision, which were not fixable so easily, especially because of the fact, that everything is quite small. Table \ref{tab:hw} gives an overview of the current satus of the hardware.
